I have expierence in Python, Javascript, Rust, C++ and hobbies in programs such as AutoCaD, Sketchup, Fusion360, and AutoDesk
I aspire to be a Aerospace Engineer/Developer and use marketing, strong leadership skills, creativity, and my public speaking expierence to hopefully make a difference in the world. 

## My Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 4, Part 2 
Lab 4 proved to be fundamental to my group as it introduced me to the workflow of software development through the process of edit-compile-run-test cycle. It allowed me to practice written instruction into working code to perform conversions. What stood out to me was black box testing, as it taught me how to verify my programs functionality by focusing on inputs and outputs. Utilizing the make command was a valuable experience towards my understanding of C++, and its a helpful tool to compile and link my C++ files together. I understood the importance of variables, operators, and input and output operands. 

Lab 6, Part 1-Part 2 
This lab helped me with the practical application of vector arguments and data structure in C++, and I also enjoyed the usage of the game blackjack as Its a fun game to play with other people. e. Using conditional statements for validation on input showcased program reliability. The usage of vectors introduced me to data containers that automatically manage the memory and provide me with flexible storage solutions. They show how far computer science has come from a traditional array based approach to where we are now. Lab 4 also utilized real world applications similar to the other labs I've chosen which I value.

Lab 8, Part 2
This lab taught me the importance of command line arguments in C++. The fundamental validation process and user input efficiency loops. The implementation of nested loops for creating patterns, helping me practice simple iterative structure and producing visual outputs that I thought I wouldn't be able to produce on my own. Working with vectors and command-line arguments opened me up to more sophisticated programming interfaces and helped me gain the satisfaction of seeing my command line inputs create calculations while also entertaining creative programming.
